Sobre a vaga
Apresentação da área
Nem sempre é possível ter uma equipe com cientistas, engenheiros, matemáticos físicos ao lado de médicos, enfermeiras, psicólogos e até lutadores de jiu-jistu no mesmo time e dentro de uma instituição de saúde reconhecida. A área de Big Data Analytics do Einstein cresceu nestes 7 anos e temos aprendido bastante. O objetivo é promover a adoção da cultura de dados na Instituição em projetos práticos que façam sempre diferença positiva na vida das pessoas com as quais interagimos, auxiliando a entender o uso destas ferramentas na saúde e a implementar, na prática, soluções analíticas em diversos cenários. A área atua por meio de projetos ajudando a organizar e obter valor relevante a partir da transformação de conhecimento médico em soluções na operação interna da instituição, de outros atores no ecossistema de saúde e também para sociedade em geral, inclusive em programas de responsabilidade social, que hoje ocupam grande parte do trabalho da equipe.

A sua atividade no Big Data
Como cientista de dados, você atuará com projetos de advanced analytics em todas as esferas da saúde, desde o cuidado contínuo do paciente, na sua jornada de atendimento (da previsão de demandas e gestão de oferta à navegação de pessoas em tempo real) e na organização de sistemas de saúde populacionais. Seu objetivo será desenvolver modelos (preditivos, prescritivos e de descoberta), para que as áreas do Hospital possam ter mais eficiência, por exemplo, quanto ao dimensionamento de equipes (médicos, técnicos, enfermeiros, etc) e demais recursos (materiais, exames, etc); quanto à utilização de ferramentas para promoção da saúde orientando individuais pessoas com dados/predições; quanto a redução do tempo de espera do paciente e em última análise aumentando a eficiência do sistema de saúde e a experiência dos pacientes

Responsabilidades
Tratar, transformar e organizar dados (estruturados, semi-estruturados ou não-estruturados), com uso de habilidades em matemática, estatística, programação, machine learning e outros, para identificar soluções para os problemas de negócios e contribuir na tomada de decisões e estratégias da instituição;
Explorar e analisar dados de uma variedade de ângulos para determinar fraquezas escondidas, tendências e / ou oportunidades para gerar valor ao negócio e a sociedade;
Conceber soluções orientadas a dados para os desafios mais prementes da instituição e da sociedade;
Desenvolver novos algoritmos e/ou adaptar algoritmos do estado da arte para resolver problemas e criar novas ferramentas para automatizar o trabalho;
Comunicar de maneira clara previsões e resultados para as áreas demandantes, através de visualizações de dados eficazes e storytelling, adotando gráficos, tabelas, relatórios e, principalmente, narrativas para apresentar conclusões de um projeto de análise de dados para um público não técnico;
Recomendar mudanças nos procedimentos e estratégias da Instituição decorrentes de informações geradas durante a análise de dados;
Utilizar os dados de forma ética e de acordo com as políticas de segurança da informação da instituição e da lei geral de proteção de dados.


Requisitos
Cálculo multivariável e álgebra linear;
Estatística descritiva, inferencial e escolas de probabilidade (tais como: frequentista e bayesiana);
Data wrangling: limpeza e manipulação de dados, extrair informações de arquivos, regular expressions, transformações matemáticas e domínio de queries em banco de dados relacionais;
Programação em linguagens de Data Science (tais como: R, Python, SQL e Matlab). Conhecimentos de pacotes como: Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Tidyverse, Caret, Data.table, Shiny, Forecast entre outros;
Métodos de análise avançada utilizando ferramentas de inteligência artificial: machine learning (aprendizagem supervisionada e não supervisionada); deep learning (e suas variantes)
Comunicação, visualização de dados e data storytelling;
Pensamento crítico


Desejável

Introduction

As a Data Scientist at IBM, you will help transform our clients’ data into tangible business value by analyzing information, communicating outcomes and collaborating on product development. Work with Best in Class open source and visual tools, along with the most flexible and scalable deployment options. Whether it’s investigating patient trends or weather patterns, you will work to solve real world problems for the industries transforming how we live.

Your Role and Responsibilities

Data Scientist is a role for quantitatively adept people with accompanying business skills. A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science and applications, and math. What sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen, coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. Good data scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization. A data scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution, thereby realizing business value. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source – a CRM system, for example – a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The data scientist will extract, transform, and combine all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A data scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also builds statistical models, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data. Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing ""what if"" analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processes. Armed with data, modeling expertise, and analytical results, a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization's leadership structure. The employee focuses on individual/team/department/ operational objectives.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re "old" (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can’t put us in a box!

But "Digital Transformation" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world-changing? Be you, with us!

Introduction

As a Data Scientist at IBM, you will help transform our clients’ data into tangible business value by analyzing information, communicating outcomes and collaborating on product development. Work with Best in Class open source and visual tools, along with the most flexible and scalable deployment options. Whether it’s investigating patient trends or weather patterns, you will work to solve real world problems for the industries transforming how we live.

Your Role and Responsibilities

Data Scientist is a role for quantitatively adept people with accompanying business skills. A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science and applications, and math. What sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen, coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. Good data scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization. A data scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution, thereby realizing business value. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source – a CRM system, for example – a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The data scientist will extract, transform, and combine all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A data scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also builds statistical models, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data. Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing ""what if"" analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processes. Armed with data, modeling expertise, and analytical results, a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization's leadership structure. The employee focuses on individual/team objectives and development of professional effectiveness.

We would like to find a senior engineer who will join the Ecosystem Solutions group as part of our newly formed COPA team (Components for Partners) in Alphaville, São Paulo.

What are Components for Partners?

We are looking to hire a senior full-stack engineer to build these common core components that multiple Netflix teams will use to deliver their applications worldwide. These components will leverage the Netflix cloud-based tech stack using Java, Node, React, SQL and NoSQL databases. In this role, you will lead cross-functional initiatives and have the opportunity to drive a project from requirements through first deployment ensuring the satisfaction of our users. You will also play a key role in the development of the overall architecture that spans our portfolio of 60+ applications and services.

The best candidate will be truly excited by the prospect of designing and building the common components that will allow us to continue the rapid growth of our portfolio; which underpins integration, certification and monitoring the experience for Netflix integrations across 500+ partners and over 1800 different device types (most likely including the TV sitting in your living room right now!).

You have a passion for solving business needs by building platforms using a combination of innovative spirit and pragmatism complemented by technical acumen.
You evangelize new ideas and exemplify technical leadership with a bias for action.
You possess strong skills in system design and architecture with a keen eye for progressive evolution of software solutions.

You have experience building platforms that scale.
You ideally will have a B.S. Computer Science or equivalent.
3+ years of relevant industry experience.

You Will Love This Job Because

You drive software solutions across teams, in a multi-disciplinary manner.
You appreciate the complexity of engaging with a global challenge.

The results of our work can be seen around the world by hundreds of millions Netflix members.

We would like to find a senior engineer who will join the Ecosystem Solutions group as part of our newly formed COPA team (Components for Partners) in Alphaville, São Paulo.

What are Components for Partners? As we have deployed more and more “partner facing” products (like the Netflix application on Smart TVs, payment, voice and search integrations, and our mobile game SDK), we’ve noticed that there are many similarities in the tools we’ve built to support them. We are looking to hire a senior full-stack engineer to build these common core components that multiple Netflix teams will use to deliver their applications worldwide. These components will leverage the Netflix cloud-based tech stack using Java, Node, React, SQL and NoSQL databases. In this role, you will lead cross-functional initiatives and have the opportunity to drive a project from requirements through first deployment ensuring the satisfaction of our users. You will also play a key role in the development of the overall architecture that spans our portfolio of 60+ applications and services.

The best candidate will be truly excited by the prospect of designing and building the common components that will allow us to continue the rapid growth of our portfolio; which underpins integration, certification and monitoring the experience for Netflix integrations across 500+ partners and over 1800 different device types (most likely including the TV sitting in your living room right now!).

You Will Succeed In The Role Because

You have a passion for solving business needs by building platforms using a combination of innovative spirit and pragmatism complemented by technical acumen.
You evangelize new ideas and exemplify technical leadership with a bias for action.
You possess strong skills in system design and architecture with a keen eye for progressive evolution of software solutions.
You possess strong software skills in Javascript (React/Node) with expertise in industry-standard frameworks and are familiar with Java.
You have experience building platforms that scale.
You ideally will have a B.S. Computer Science or equivalent.
8+ years of relevant industry experience.

You Will Love This Job Because

You drive software solutions across teams, in a multi-disciplinary manner.
You appreciate the complexity of engaging with a global challenge.
You will be surrounded by world-class engineers sharing passion and energy.
You enjoy seeing the end-to-end impact of your work.

Sobre a vaga
If you have fallen and risen, if you have broken and fixed, if you have dreamt and built, then you have grit.

Then we speak the same language.

Welcome to the Wolfpack.

About Cloudwalk:

Here at Cloudwalk, we work hard to build the best products, including different payment methods while using innovative technologies, to empower our more than 300.000 customers. Our main initiative is called InfinitePay, which is the fastest growing payments acquirer in Latam.

We hustle and celebrate as we change the market landscape and raise the bar in payments processing. We are making it cheaper and faster to receive payments and thus help to maximize small businesses' growth.

Our technology has already processed more than US$3 BI and it´s just the beginning.

We build and learn, fast, and we want the hackers, the artists, the crafters - join the Wolfpack!

You will be working in the risk team along with great engineers, risk analysts and data scientists as yourself. We are responsible for building the defense layers that keep Cloudwalk, its merchants, and users safe. We keep our ecosystem healthy by tracking down malicious activity and maintaining regulatory compliance, while providing the best user experience.

What You'll Be Doing:
You'll have access to tons of data, but you'll also be cursed with tons of noise. Most humans are good and amazing, so every bad behavior is hidden behind a swarm of good behavior. To identify the baddies, you will need to look for clues as to what is going on, to look for patterns, to ask intelligent questions and look for answers, to deal with uncertainty, to find the story behind the data, to turn the data into information. You'll need to be a detective.
You will create new ML models and techniques and expand on the ones we have in production.
You will have the chance to experiment. Do you think that the hot new model from a newly published paper can be applied to some of our data? Let's try it! Do you think the atmospheric pressure, the migration pattern of birds or the number of capybaras living on the border of the Pinheiros river are good predictors of credit card fraud? Let's investigate the data! Do you think there's a different perspective to look at a certain problem that could solve it better or complement our current approach? Let's put that to the test!
You might have taken a bunch of courses and learned all about NNs, CNNs, RNNs, SVMs, CARTs, RFs, LDA, QDA, XGB, BERT and all that nice stuff. Those are all techniques to learn a mapping from X to Y. Here, you will also have to think long and hard about what X you'll be mapping to what Y.
If you never allow yourself to fail, you will never allow yourself to take risks. The next big breakthrough will not come from someone who's playing it safe. Here, you'll be expected to experiment and you'll be allowed to fail, as long as you learn something. Over 99% of all species that ever existed on Earth are now extinct. But the remaining 1% would not have succeeded without them.
Not going to lie. Sometimes you will have to do things you might not particularly enjoy. There will be times when we'll be at war, when we'll be together in the trenches, fighting the enemy, shoulder to shoulder, doing whatever needs to be done.
As a member of a fully remote and distributed team, you are expected to complete tasks autonomously, being highly collaborative and self-driven.

What You Need To Succeed:
You must understand what machine learning is and what it’s not, and be able to identify and implement potential applications.
You must be able to go through large amounts of data and identify useful patterns and relationships.
You must be comfortable with programming. You’ll be doing most of your work in Python and SQL, but we believe that coding is mostly about problem solving and that programming skills are highly transferable between languages.
You must be able to communicate and debate in English. We’re proud to be a global team with members spread all over the world.

Nice to Have:
Experience with the financial or payments industry
Experience with Cloud platforms like GCP
You are comfortable reading and discussing research papers and coming up with potential applications to our problems.

Recruiting process outline:
Our selection method is simple but hard. If you pass, you are definitely smart.
1) Online technical assessment
2) Technical interview
3) Cultural interviews

If you are not willing to do an online quiz, do not apply.

We are not expecting candidates to have expertise across all of these areas. We will gladly help you bridge the gaps.

As a member of a fully remote and distributed team, you are expected to complete tasks autonomously, being highly collaborative and self-driven.

Diversity and Inclusion

We believe in social inclusion, respect, and appreciation of all people. We promote a welcoming work environment, where each CloudWalker can be authentic, regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, religion, sexuality, mobility, disability, or education.

Mais recentemente, fechamos uma parceria estratégia com o Itaú, e, em breve, nos tornaremos sócios do maior banco privado do Brasil, com o intuito de acelerar a digitalização do banco, oferecer soluções de investimentos, entre outros inúmeros projetos.

Introduction

As a Data Scientist at IBM, you will help transform our clients’ data into tangible business value by analyzing information, communicating outcomes and collaborating on product development. Work with Best in Class open source and visual tools, along with the most flexible and scalable deployment options. Whether it’s investigating patient trends or weather patterns, you will work to solve real world problems for the industries transforming how we live.

Your Role and Responsibilities

Data Scientist is a role for quantitatively adept people with accompanying business skills. A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science and applications, and math. What sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen, coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. Good data scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization. A data scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution, thereby realizing business value. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source – a CRM system, for example – a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The data scientist will extract, transform, and combine all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A data scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also builds statistical models, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data. Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing ""what if"" analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processes. Armed with data, modeling expertise, and analytical results, a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization's leadership structure. The employee focuses on individual/team/department/ operational objectives.

Required Technical and Professional Expertise

Databricks, Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Kafka, SQL, Java e/ou C++;
Controle de versão (Git);
Portfólio de projetos pessoais (por exemplo, Github, blog pessoal);
SPSS, SAS ou Knime;
Tableau, PowerBI, Looker;
Série Temporal, Mineração de Texto e NLP;
Redes neurais e Deep Learning (bibliotecas como Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow, H2O);
Técnicas de Reconhecimento Visual;
Experiência em programação matemática (CPLEX, Gurobi, Matlab);
Capacidade de trabalhar com plataformas de nuvem (Azure, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud ou AWS).

***Todas as vagas são elegíveis para pessoas com deficiência ou reabilitadas.***

Sobre a vaga
Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Forward Kitchens. Have you got what it takes?

On-demand food delivery is the future of restaurants. However, most restaurants are either ill-equipped or unaware of how to unlock their full delivery revenue potential through digitization. A restaurant’s digital presence could be the difference between a viral hit like Salt Bae’s booming global steak empire (which is just ok, if you ask us) and your favorite mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that went out of business during the pandemic.

That’s where Forward Kitchens comes in. We empower restaurants to create multiple digital storefronts each, generate more online sales, and increase their bottom line – all without having to hire a creative marketing team or deal with the millions (we’re exaggerating) of delivery platforms out there. We believe in our partner restaurants’ power to represent their communities and provide delicious, eclectic meals to their ever-ravenous customers at scale.

In this role, you will play a major part in building our modern restaurant operating system, including delivery tablet aggregation, automated websites, online ordering, and much more. This is a fast-paced, high-impact work environment, so be prepared to move quickly and ship often. If you’re a Python developer with experience working in a fast-paced engineering culture and a keen eye for detail, then this role is for you!

What You Will Be Doing

Scraping data from third parties
Developing new backend features, like API endpoints, job queues, and data acquisition platforms
Building resilient data strategies for structured and unstructured data

What You Won’t Be Doing

Working on minor bug fixes or features on outdated codebases
Dealing with tedious infrastructure to enable poorly written products to continue running
Managing people or getting stuck on long meetings discussing roadmaps and priorities

Basic Requirements

Python Developer key responsibilities

At least 3 years of professional experience coding with Python and SQL
Professional experience using HTTP + TCP/IP
Professional experience scraping data from third parties

About Forward Kitchens

Off-premise operating system for restaurants.

There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!

Working with Crossover

This is a full-time (40 hours per week), long-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover. The compensation level for this role is $30 USD/hour, which equates to $60,000 USD/year assuming 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. The payment period is weekly. Consult www.crossover.com/help-and-faqs for more details on this topic.

What to expect next:

You will receive an email with a link to start your self-paced, online job application.
Our hiring platform will guide you through a series of online “screening” assessments to check for basic job fit, job-related skills, and finally a few real-world job-specific assignments.

Important! If you do not receive an email from us:

First, emails may take up to 15 minutes to send, refresh and check again.
Second, check your spam and junk folders for an email from Crossover.com, mark as “Not Spam” since you will receive other emails as well.
Third, we will send to whatever email account you indicated on the Apply form - by default, that is the email address you use as your LinkedIn username and it might be different than the one you have already checked.
If all else fails, just reset your password by visiting https://www.crossover.com/auth/reset-password if you already applied using LinkedIn EasyApply.

You will do this using the latest, bleeding-edge Atlas libraries and platforms, as well as other tools in the data ecosystem.

You won’t be alone - but will be working with our seasoned quant & ML team.

Currently our team is still small, meaning you’ll be able to have huge impact on the overall direction of Atlas and shape the future with our users and ourselves.This also means this isn’t your “traditional” ML engineering role. You’ll be expected to widen your horizon, from understanding user needs, technical limitations, and company strategy...it’s a complex task.

What we're looking for
What we’re looking for is a strong, collaborative ML engineer who can easily interface with our quant and backend teams with a product-minded focus.

We’re looking for the following key traits for our next team members:
You can ship. You should be effectively be able to support the shipping culture - meaning you have diverse skillsets from generating ideas for data sources and model architectures to bringing those - once agreed upon - to scalable production.
System thinking. What we're building is quite complex - and elements connect to each other in unexpected ways. Being able to see the full picture, while drilling down into details is a must.
Curiosity & Always learning. You're interested in new trends in your domain. You see keeping up-to-date with the latest standards, tools, and (to an extent) research as a core part of your job.
Collaborative. We ship as a team - and great ideas & solutions come from every member of this team. You're honest with both giving and taking feedback - and take pride in delivering the best possible solution versus being emotionally attached to a single idea.

Our stack is PyTorch, Kafka, Terraform, and MLFlow. The central challenges here are the multimodality of the data, lowest-possible latency inference, and being creative about what data to source and how to source it.

Bonus points
Solid knowledge of ML testing and documentation best practices
Previous startup experience
Previous experience building a highly-scaled product
You have previous experience in a PM-focused company
Team- and culture-oriented
You have passion for technological advancement and web3

A Z1 atua através da educação financeira adolescente, ou seja, criamos funcionalidades para aprenderem a ter responsabilidade financeira e acesso à economia digital com independência.

Começamos a nossa história em 2019 e lançamos o nosso app em janeiro de 2021. Desde então, estamos crescendo a uma taxa de 30% por mês, e já recebemos mais de R$73 milhões em aportes de investidores de primeira linha, como a aceleradora Y Combinator e os fundos de venture capital Kaszek, MAYA Capital, Homebrew, Mantis e Clocktower, entre outros.

Saiba mais em http://z1.app/ e nessas matérias no Exame, O Globo, Brazil Journal, e Estadão.

Diversidade

Diversidade na Z1 é o ponto de partida de toda e qualquer ação nossa.
Hoje, nossos números internos refletem nosso compromisso. Por isso, dentro do nosso quadro de pessoas colaboradoras, temos:
- 18% de pessoas transgênero;
- 53% de pessoas pretas/pardas;
- 53% de mulheres.

Além disso, pensamos Diversidade desde a abertura de novas vagas, passando por ações internas e chegando a benefícios. Alguns exemplos do que você vai encontrar aqui:

- Comitê de Diversidade;
- Benefícios exclusivos para pessoas minorizadas;
- Área de Diversidade e Inclusão sempre atenta e criativa, com um olhar voltado para novas formas de continuarmos trazendo o tema como ponto central das nossas ações.

Queremos ser a empresa referência em diversidade no Brasil e estamos só começando!

Introduction

As a Data Scientist at IBM, you will help transform our clients’ data into tangible business value by analyzing information, communicating outcomes and collaborating on product development. Work with Best in Class open source and visual tools, along with the most flexible and scalable deployment options. Whether it’s investigating patient trends or weather patterns, you will work to solve real world problems for the industries transforming how we live.

Your Role and Responsibilities

Data Scientist is a role for quantitatively adept people with accompanying business skills. A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science and applications, and math. What sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen, coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. Good data scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization. A data scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution, thereby realizing business value. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source – a CRM system, for example – a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The data scientist will extract, transform, and combine all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A data scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also builds statistical models, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data. Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing ""what if"" analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processes. Armed with data, modeling expertise, and analytical results, a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization's leadership structure. The employee focuses on individual/team/department/ operational objectives.

Nessa jornada, também geramos aprendizado e nos fortalecemos na diversidade das pessoas como aspecto fundamental para o nosso crescimento dia após dia.

5) Inglês intermediário para leitura e escrita (muitos dos materiais e apresentações são em inglês)
Competências adicionais:
1) Conhecimento intermediário em excel, powerpoint e word
2) Inglês intermediário para falar (o time é internacional, então a exposição vai depender da lingua)

What You'll Do

You'll work in teams of typically 3 - 5 consultants to identify, and oftentimes implement, potential solutions for a specific client problem or challenge. Together, you will help clients make lasting improvements to their performance and realize their most important goals.

Over the course of each project, you will gather and analyze information, formulate, and test hypotheses, and develop and communicate recommendations. You'll also present results to client management and implement recommendations in collaboration with client team members. In some cases, you will be asked to travel to your client site.

We encourage you to explore different content areas or geographies through a year-long rotation with one of our practices (e.g., corporate finance, social sector, healthcare, operations) or global offices; many do this after two years as a generalist business analyst. You will likely intersect with many elements of our firm’s work including digital, implementation, and tech and analytics capabilities – either by collaborating on teams or working with colleagues from these group.

Following your business analyst tenure, assuming good performance, you will move into a post-graduate school role.

Sobre a vaga
Are you a data engineer who is excited about brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that increase human agency? Are you a self-starter who is comfortable with ambiguity and wants to tackle challenging engineering problems? Do you want to work with a world-class remote team while having a big impact on the data infrastructure for an early-stage project?

We are looking for a Data Engineer who is interested in working with us at AE Studio on the future of neurotechnology!

About AE Studio

AE Studio is a mid-sized startup from California. We have a team of highly skilled developers, designers, and data scientists building products that increase human agency. We use the most recent technologies to develop solutions for startups as well as large companies like Samsung and Berkshire Hathaway. We have an awesome work environment and a highly productive process.

One of AE Studio’s core missions is to develop brain-computer interface technologies that increase human agency. We are looking for someone with experience in data engineering, strong problem-solving skills, self-management skills, and enthusiasm to learn more about the intersection of data science and neuroscience.

About The Role

You will work full-time on software, tools, and data infrastructure for BCI technology as we work to develop an operating system for BCI applications. Initially, you will be structuring neural datasets for use in machine learning. As your project grows, you’ll build toolsets and pipelines to convert between common neurodata formats, manage data architecture in the cloud to support machine learning, and work on open-source neurodata format and standard projects (such as Neurodata Without Borders or MNE). This is a highly dynamic role that will require a bright and flexible engineer with excellent problem-solving skills.

You
Are a mature Python developer who follows best practices and writes clean code
Have experience building Python packages and applications for production environments
Have experience building data pipelines and data management utilities
Have a solid foundation in data engineering best practices
Are comfortable working in a cloud environment
Have experience with scientific computing (including but not limited to: writing software to collect data from laboratory instruments, to control those instruments, or to model physical systems based on scientific theory)
Have included a link to your public code repository (e.g. GitHub) in your application
Bonus Points For
Experience with managing AWS infrastructure for a project (EC2, S3, databases, IAM, etc)
Experience with unit testing in Python
Experience contributing to the open-source community
Machine learning and/or data science experience
Neuroscience and/or BCI experience
What do you get out of it??
Opportunity to work on world-changing technology
Collaborative & friendly remote work environment (we're all nice 🤗)
Good pay 💰
Reasonable & flexible work hours
Private health insurance plan
Yearly retreat bringing together our teams from across the world
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.
Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.

Training Program /

Full-time

Pre-apply for our next program to indicate your interest

Who We Are:

Factored was conceived in Palo Alto, California by Andrew Ng and a team of highly experienced AI researchers, educators, and engineers to help address the significant shortage of qualified AI & Machine-Learning engineers globally. We know that exceptional technical aptitude, intelligence, communication skills, and passion are equally distributed worldwide, and we are very committed to testing, vetting, and nurturing the most talented engineers for our program and on behalf of our clients.

About The Training Program:

Factored brings to LATAM the best educational resources in AI directly from Silicon Valley. Our training program has already delivered five cohorts of engineers and will be launching another one in 2023. Factored provides a 3-month full-time training in AI and offers selected Trainees full-time job opportunities to work on cutting-edge AI projects. The training program comes with no upfront costs. Additionally, we pay a monthly stipend to cover your living costs while on training.

What You Can Expect:

Members of our training team include: AI experts, educators, and industry AI leaders. The training program content aims at making engineers industry-ready in 3 months. The key to our program success is a philosophy centered around learning by doing. More specifically the program entails:

Online content with extended discussions, assignments and weekly projects.
Guided hands-on projects based on state-of-the-art approaches to ML.
Capstone projects based on challenging real-world problems.
Workshops and talks.
Mentorship and soft-skill development.

The training program covers the technical challenges behind AI, from the algorithmic foundations up to the computational challenges to build and scale successful AI systems in real-world problems.

What you must bring:

1+ years of experience in data-related projects reflected in any of the following: work experience, theses, articles, publications, conferences, and other projects.
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Economics or other engineering fields.
Strong Math, Calculus, Linear Algebra and Statistics foundations.
Strong problem solvers and quick learners.
Excellent English communication skills and the ability to have in-depth technical discussions with both the engineering team and business people.

Desirable:

MSc, Ph.D. or other studies is a plus.
Proficiency in any programming language. Python is a plus.

When does the training program start?

Starting date to be defined in 2023. You will receive all the information and updates by email.
The program will run for approximately 3 months.
Remote training program.

How much does the training program cost?

Factored does not charge upfront; we pay a monthly stipend for our scholars, and if they successfully complete the program, we offer them full-time employment. When joining the training program, you will agree to sign a blank promissory note with the equivalent amount of the training program investment. However, if you remain a Factored employee for 2.5 years, the entire training cost is considered to have been repaid.

What is the admission process?

Candidates need to complete online applications.
Candidates who pass the resume screening will receive two online technical tests.
Qualified candidates will receive instructions for tech interviews.

At Factored, we believe that passionate, smart people expect honesty and transparency, as well as the freedom to do the best work of their lives while learning and growing as much as possible. Great people enjoy working with other passionate, smart people, so we believe in hiring right, and are very selective about who joins our team. Once we hire you, we will invest in you and support your career and professional growth in many meaningful ways. We hire people who are supremely intelligent and talented, but we recognize that intelligence is not enough. Perhaps more importantly, we look for those who are also passionate about our mission and are honest, diligent, collaborative, kind to others, and fun to be around. Life is too short to work with people who don’t inspire you.

We are a transparent workplace, where EVERYBODY has a voice in building OUR company, and where learning and growth is available to everyone based on their merits, not just on stamps on their resume. As impressive as some of the stamps on our resumes are, we recognize that human talent and passion exist everywhere, and come from many backgrounds, so stamps matter much less than results. All of us are dedicated doers and are highly energetic, focusing vehemently on execution because we know that the best learning happens by doing. We recognize that we are creating OUR COMPANY TOGETHER, which is not only a high-performing fast-growing business, but is changing the way the world perceives the quality of technical talent in Latin America. We are fueled by the great positive impact we are making in the places where we do business, and are committed to accelerating careers and investing in hundreds (and hopefully thousands) of highly talented data science engineers and data analysts.

In short, our business is about people, so we hire the best people and invest as much as possible in making them fall in love with their work, their learning, and their mission. When not nerding out on data science, we love to make music together, play sports, play games, dance salsa, cook delicious food, brew the best coffee, throw the best parties, and generally have a great time with each other.

Our goal is to create software that offers customers a unique shopping experience that is internationalized for their preferences.

Our team is responsible for automating the launch strategy for Amazon's expansion into new countries. We build customer-facing features in a highly distributed environment that directly impacts Amazon’s e-commerce revenue in over 150+ countries.

About You

You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You build customer facing features that reach millions of new customers all over the world. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are leveraging Machine Learning models to implement solutions to real problems that require creative and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. You work closely with the business to define the expansion strategy and figure out innovative solutions to help this thriving business continue its exponential growth.

About Us Together

We're going to eliminate vendor complexity so they can make products available in any market place. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.

The ideal engineer for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment and passion for building a great customer experience, be inventive, and have a strong track record of delivery. You also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams.

Questions?

You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible.

2+ years of non-internship professional software development experience
1+ years of experience contributing to the system design or architecture (architecture, design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and current systems.
Programming experience with at least one software programming language.
Preferred Qualifications
Master’s degree in computer science, Math or Physics or related field.
Experience building complex software systems that have been successfully delivered to customers.
A high degree of pragmatism in building the simplest thing that does the job; we want to use technology to solve real-world problems expediently, not indulge in over-designed, unnecessarily intricate software architecture.
A willingness to dive deep, experiment rapidly and get things done.
A good understanding of SDLC models and a track record of shipping software efficiently. You recognize the difference between building software and shipping software.
Exceptional customer relationship skills including the ability to discover the true requirements underlying feature requests, recommend alternative technical and business approaches, and lead engineering efforts to meet aggressive timelines with optimal solutions.
A strong track record of project delivery for large, cross-functional, projects.
Deep hands-on technical expertise, excellent verbal and written communication skills.
